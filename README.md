# CLONE

## üî• News

- \[2025-06\] We release the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08931) and [demos]().




## üè† About

<!-- ![Teaser](assets/teaser.jpg) -->

CLONE employs an MoE-based policy with <b>closed-loop error correction</b> for holistic humanoid teleoperation, enabling capabilities previously unattainable with existing systems‚Äîsuch as <b>whole-body coordination</b> and <b>long-horizon task execution</b>.
Using only minimal input from a commercial MR headset, CLONE significantly improves tracking precision over existing open-loop approaches, opening new possibilities for practical humanoid deployment in unstructured environments.







<!-- ## üìö Getting Started

### Prerequisites


### Installation


### Training and Deployment -->








## üìù TODO List

- \[x\] Release the paper with demos.
- \[ \] Release checkpoints(which we used for real-world deployment).
- \[ \] Release blogs for real-world deployment.
- \[ \] Release training code.
- \[ \] Full release and further updates.
