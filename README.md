# CLONE

## üî• News

- \[2025-08\] **CLONE** is **accepted** by [CoRL](https://www.corl.org)!

- \[2025-07\] We release **CLONE**'s early checkpoint and [deploy document](https://github.com/humanoid-clone/CLONE/blob/main/deploy/README.md).

- \[2025-06\] We release the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08931) and [demos]().




## üè† About

<!-- ![Teaser](assets/teaser.jpg) -->

**CLONE** employs an MoE-based policy with <b>closed-loop error correction</b> for holistic humanoid teleoperation, enabling capabilities previously unattainable with existing systems‚Äîsuch as <b>whole-body coordination</b> and <b>long-horizon task execution</b>.
Using only minimal input from a commercial MR headset, **CLONE** significantly improves tracking precision over existing open-loop approaches, opening new possibilities for practical humanoid deployment in unstructured environments.







<!-- ## üìö Getting Started

### Prerequisites


### Installation


### Training and Deployment -->








## üìù TODO List

- \[x\] Release the paper with demos.
- \[x\] Release early checkpoints(used for real-world deployment).
- \[x\] Release instructions for real-world deployment.
- \[ \] Release training and inference code with [**Roboverse**](https://github.com/RoboVerseOrg/RoboVerse).
- \[ \] Release enhanced checkpoints.
- \[ \] Full codebase release and further updates.
